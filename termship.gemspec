This is a simple implementation of the classic battleship game using the curses library to draw the game board and handle user input. The game is played on a 10x10 grid where the player and the computer each place 5 ships. The player and the computer take turns to guess the position of the ships and the first one to sink all the ships of the opponent wins the game. The game is played in the terminal and uses the curses library to draw the game board and handle user input."
